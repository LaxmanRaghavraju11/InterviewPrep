					What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 datatype in SQL? 	"Both of these data types are used for characters, but varchar2 is used for character strings of variable length, whereas char is used for character strings of fixed length. For example, if we specify the type as char(5) then we will not be allowed to store a string of any other length in this variable, but if we specify the type of this variable as varchar2(5) then we will be allowed to store strings of variable length. We can store a string of length 3 or 4 or 2 in this variable.

					What do you mean by data definition language? 	Data definition language or DDL allows to execution of queries like CREATE, DROP, and ALTER. That is those queries that define the data.	
					What do you mean by data manipulation language?	"Data manipulation Language or DML is used to access or manipulate data in the database. It allows us to perform the below-listed functions: 

Insert data or rows in a database
Delete data from the database
Retrieve or fetch data
Update data in a database."	
					What is the view in SQL? 	"Views in SQL are a kind of virtual table. A view also has rows and columns as they are on a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain conditions.
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;"	
					What is a Default constraint?	"The DEFAULT constraint is used to fill a column with default and fixed values. The value will be added to all new records when no other value is provided.
"	
					What is Auto Increment?	Sometimes, while creating a table, we do not have a unique identifier within the table, hence we face difficulty in choosing Primary Key. So as to resolve such an issue, we’ve to manually provide unique keys to every record, but this is often also a tedious task. So we can use the  Auto-Increment feature that automatically generates a numerical Primary key value for every new record inserted	
					What is a  stored procedure?	Stored Procedures are created to perform one or more DML operations on databases. It is nothing but a group of SQL statements that accepts some input in the form of parameters and performs some task and may or may not return a value	
					What is SQL injection?	SQL injection is a technique used to exploit user data through web page inputs by injecting SQL commands as statements. Basically, these statements can be used to manipulate the application’s web server by malicious users.	
					".SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE
STUDENT-ID == 12222345 or 1 = 1
SQL Injection based on 1=1 is always true. As you can see in the above example, 1=1 will return all records for which this holds true. So basically, all the student data is compromised"		
					What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators in SQL? 	"BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator is used to fetch rows based on a range of values. 
For example, 

SELECT * FROM Students 
WHERE ROLL_NO BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
This query will select all those rows from the table. Students where the value of the field ROLL_NO lies between 20 and 30. 
IN: The IN operator is used to check for values contained in specific sets. 
For example, 

SELECT * FROM Students 
WHERE ROLL_NO IN (20,21,23);"	
					What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints? 	The primary key cannot have NULL values, the unique constraints can have NULL values. There is only one primary key in a table, but there can be multiple unique constraints	
					What is a join in SQL? What are the types of joins? 	"An SQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. Different types of Joins are: 

INNER JOIN: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as the condition is satisfied. This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e. the value of the common field will be the same.
LEFT JOIN: This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows for the table on the right side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the right side, the result set will be null. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN
RIGHT JOIN: RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the left side, the result set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
FULL JOIN: FULL JOIN creates the result set by combining the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The result set will contain all the rows from both tables. For the rows for which there is no matching, the result set will contain NULL values.

					".WITH clause
Suppose we have a table named ""orders"" with columns ""order_id,"" ""product_id,"" and ""order_date."" We want to find the total number of orders for each product in the year 2023 using a CTE:"	"WITH ProductOrders AS (
    SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT product_id, order_count
FROM ProductOrders
WHERE product_id IN (1, 2);"	
					What is a trigger?	The trigger is a statement that a system executes automatically when there is any modification to the database. In a trigger, we first specify when the trigger is to be executed and then the action to be performed when the trigger executes	
					What is Case WHEN in SQL?	"The CASE statement is SQL’s way of handling if/then logic
CASE case_value    WHEN when_value THEN statement_list    [WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] …    [ELSE statement_list]END CASE"	
					What are local and global variables and their differences?	"Global Variable: In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions. These variables have global scope, so they can be used by any function without passing them to the function as parameters.

Local Variable: Local variables are variables that are defined within functions. They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them."	
					Explain SQL AND OR statement with an example?	"In SQL, the AND & OR operators are used for filtering the data and getting precise results based on conditions. The AND and OR operators are used with the WHERE clause.

These two operators are called conjunctive operators.

AND Operator: This operator displays only those records where both conditions condition 1 and condition 2 evaluate to True.
OR Operator: This operator displays the records where either one of the conditions condition 1 and condition 2 evaluates to True. That is, either condition1 is True or condition2 is True"	
					COALESCE():	" COALESCE function in SQL returns the first non-NULL expression among its arguments. If all the expressions evaluate to null, then the COALESCE function will return null.
Syntax:


SELECT column(s), CAOLESCE(expression_1,….,expression_n)FROM table_name;"	
					Aggregate functions	" Count()
 Sum()
 Avg()
 Min()
 Max()
"	
					what are sql joins?	"Type of Joins	Description
-----------------------------
INNER JOIN	Returns only the rows with matching values from both tables.
LEFT JOIN	Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN	Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
FULL OUTER JOIN	Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match."
